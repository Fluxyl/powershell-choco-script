# powershell-choco-script

A script I created to reinstall a bunch of software that I use. The reason for making this is I tend to reinstall Windows many times due to tinkering with the OS or due to hardware problems causing corruption issues that can't be solved easily.

Powershell is a really awesome language, and I had no clue it could do such awesome things when combined with the Windows Package Manager Chocolatey. You can learn more about Chocolatey and its features at [this link](https://chocolatey.org/why-chocolatey).

## Installation
Follow the instructions at [this link](https://chocolatey.org/install).
Then, launch a PowerShell instance with admin elevation, and run my script.

Big thanks to Chocolatey for allowing all of this to be possible; it saves me a large amount of time during every reinstall.
